        Swami Vivekananda was born on January 12, 1863, in Kolkata (formerly
        Calcutta), India, into a well-educated, affluent family. His birth name
        was Narendranath Datta, and he was the eldest of nine siblings. His
        father, Vishwanath Datta, was a lawyer, and his mother, Bhuvaneshwari
        Devi, was a deeply religious woman. Narendranath grew up in an
        intellectually stimulating environment, with exposure to both Western
        philosophy and Indian spirituality. His early life was marked by a deep
        curiosity and a quest for truth.

      <p class="text-red-700 font-semibold text-xl leading-[37px]">
        Vivekananda was a bright student from childhood, excelling in both
        academic subjects and extracurricular activities. He studied at the
        Metropolitan Institution and later at the Scottish Church College in
        Kolkata, where he came into contact with Western philosophy, science,
        and religion. He was particularly influenced by the works of Immanuel
        Kant, John Stuart Mill, and the teachings of Raja Yoga. However, his
        true spiritual education began under the guidance of his guru, Sri
        Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, who profoundly impacted his life and vision.
        Vivekananda’s intellectual depth and spiritual insight made him one of
        the foremost scholars and spiritual leaders of his time.

        Swami Vivekananda did not marry, as he chose a life of renunciation and
        spiritual pursuit. During his early years, there were suggestions by his
        family for him to marry, but he remained resolute in his decision to
        dedicate his life to the service of humanity and the realization of
        higher spiritual truths. His intense devotion to the spiritual path and
        his desire to lead a life of renunciation made marriage inconceivable
        for him. Instead, his relationship with his guru, Sri Ramakrishna, and
        his spiritual mission became his life’s purpose. Vivekananda believed
        that the true purpose of life was to realize one's divine nature and
        serve the nation and humanity, rather than following conventional social
        norms.

        Swami Vivekananda passed away on July 19, 1902, at the age of 39. His
        death was sudden and unexpected, leaving a deep void in the spiritual
        and intellectual landscape of India. He had been in a period of intense
        spiritual activity and public work, having delivered countless lectures
        and established the Ramakrishna Mission to carry forward the teachings
        of his guru. Vivekananda's death at a young age was seen as a great
        loss, but his teachings continue to inspire millions across the world.
        He was known for his visionary ideas on spirituality, education, and
        social reform. His final words, "You have to grow from the inside out,"
        reflect his enduring philosophy of self-realization and inner strength.
